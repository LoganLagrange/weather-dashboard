## Description
        
The purpose of the weather dashboard is to give travellers a place to go where they can search cities and get the current and 5 day forecast for the city. The previously searched cities are added to the page so that the user can toggle back and forth between cities. The dashboard uses html, css, and javascript. The Open Weather Map api was used for the weather data and bootstrap was used as a css framework.
